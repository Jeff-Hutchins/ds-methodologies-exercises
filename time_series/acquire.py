# Exercises

# All of the exercises for this module should be done within your 
# ds-methodologies repository, inside of a directory named time_series.

# The end result of this exercise should be a file named acquire.py.

# Using the code from the lesson as a guide, create a dataframe 
# named items that has all of the data for items.

# Do the same thing, but for stores.

# Extract the data for sales. There are a lot of pages of data here, 
# so your code will need to be a little more complex. Your code should 
# continue fetching data from the next page until all of the data is 
# extracted.

# Save the data in your files to local csv files so that it will be 
# faster to access in the future.

# Combine the data from your three separate dataframes into one 
# large dataframe.

# Acquire the Open Power Systems Data for Germany, which has been 
# rapidly expanding its renewable energy production in recent years. 
# The data set includes country-wide totals of electricity consumption, 
# wind power production, and solar power production for 2006-2017. 
# You can get the data 
# here: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jenfly/opsd/master/opsd_germany_daily.csv

# Make sure all the work that you have done above is reproducible. 
# That is, you should put the code above into separate functions 
# in the acquire.py file and be able to re-run the functions and 
# get the same data.
